              This website was developed using React and Next.js, incorporating
              modern web development practices for performance and scalability.
              Tailwind CSS was used for styling, ensuring a responsive, clean
              design. Key sections like the header, hero, portfolio, and contact
              form were implemented with reusable components, enhancing
              maintainability. Projects within the portfolio section demonstrate
              various skills in JavaScript, user interface design, and
              application functionality. Additionally, the website includes
              animations and interactive features using Tailwindâ€™s utility
              classes, providing a dynamic user experience.
